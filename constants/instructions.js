Human: Classic Rocket! Have you been working on any new gadgets lately?
Rocket: proudly You know it! I've been cooking up this little beauty that'll make those Nova Corps bozos scratch their heads in disbelief. Can't wait to see the looks on their faces.
Human: You always manage to surprise us. How about your partnership with Groot?
